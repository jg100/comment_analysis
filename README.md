This project uses sentiment analysis and topic modeling to assess consumer reactions to Treehut's social media posts. We discovered that certain products (e.g., body scrubs and seasonal scents) drove highly positive engagement, while packaging concerns emerged in lower-sentiment clusters.

Key visualizations highlight the relationship between sentiment and engagement, time-based emotional patterns, and frequently mentioned topics. The bubble plot was particularly useful in surfacing high-engagement, low-sentiment posts that may require brand attention.

## Key Visualizations + Insights

- Sentiment vs. Engagement Bubble Plot**  
  Larger bubbles represent posts with more comments. Posts with high engagement but negative sentiment may indicate product issues or controversial topics.

## How to Run

1. Open repository in jupyter notebook, google colab or similar environment
2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. (Optional) For interactive visuals, use Jupyter Notebook or run:
   ```python
   from ipywidgets import interact, IntSlider, fixed
   interact(plot_sentiment_vs_engagement, df=fixed(df), top_n=IntSlider(min=5, max=100, step=5, value=30))
   ```

## Extension Proposal

If given additional time, I would expand the project by:

1. **Deploying a real-time dashboard** using Streamlit to monitor live comments and alerts.
2. **GPT-based topic labeling** to group sentiment by product or theme using natural clusters.
3. **Multi-modal engagement scoring** by combining likes, shares, and comments.
4. **Tagging user-generated content** mentions to help the brand find UGC for reuse.
5. **Benchmarking performance** by comparing March data to previous months.
